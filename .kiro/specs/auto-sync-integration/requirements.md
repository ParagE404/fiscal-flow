# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Auto-Sync Integration extends the existing FinVista personal finance dashboard with automated data synchronization capabilities. This feature enables users to automatically fetch and update their investment data from official sources including mutual fund NAV updates, EPF balance tracking, and stock/ETF price updates. The system maintains privacy-first principles by only connecting to official data providers while keeping all user data on their self-hosted server.

## Requirements

5. WHEN sync completes THEN the system SHALL update the "Last Synced" timestamp for mutual funds
6. WHEN sync fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and maintain existing values without disruption
7. WHEN users add new mutual funds THEN the system SHALL require ISIN code entry for auto-sync capability
